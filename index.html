            <h3>AKA, The Ratel</h3>
            <p>The honey badger (Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel,
              is the only species in the mustelid subfamily Mellivorinae and its only genus Mellivora.
              It is native to Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its name,
              the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical
              similarities to weasels.</p>
